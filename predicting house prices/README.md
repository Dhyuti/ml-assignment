# California Housing Price Prediction

Model that predicts the housing prices using linear regression.

## Introduction

This Python script demonstrates how to build a simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices in California using the scikit-learn library.
The script prints out the MAE and MSE on the test set to evaluate the model performance. It also makes a sample prediction on a new data point to demonstrate usage.

It also makes a sample prediction on a new data point to demonstrate usage.

## Dependencies

- numpy 
- scikit-learn

## Usage

- Load `fetch_california_housing` dataset.
- Split into train/test sets.
- Train Linear Regression model.
- Evaluate MAE and MSE on test set.
- Make prediction on new data point.
