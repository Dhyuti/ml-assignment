# California Housing Price Prediction

Creating an ML model using linear regression to predict housing prices.

## Introduction

This Python script demonstrates how to build a simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using `california_housing dataset` dataset using the scikit-learn library. The script prints out the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set to evaluate the model's performance.

It also makes a sample prediction on a new data point to demonstrate its usage.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- scikit-learn
