# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

Creating an ML model for sentiment analysis. 

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in Python. 
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. 
In this project, we use a pre-trained BERT-based model to classify the sentiment of text reviews, such as movie reviews.
